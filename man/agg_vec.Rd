\details{
An aggregation vector is a special type of \code{\link[=node_vec]{node_vec()}} consisting of a
single parent (the 'aggregated' value) and its children. Aggregated values
are identified by a logical vector passed to the \code{aggregated} argument, and
disaggregated values are provided in \code{x}. Aggregated values are displayed
as \verb{<aggregated>} by default.

agg_vec(
  x = c(NA, "A", "B"),
  aggregated = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
)
